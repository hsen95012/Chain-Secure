# EtherVault

## Project Title
**EtherVault – A Secure Vault for Storing and Managing Ether**

## Project Description
EtherVault is a decentralized smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to securely deposit and withdraw Ether. The system maintains an on-chain balance for every user, allowing transparent and tamper-proof fund management without intermediaries.

The goal of EtherVault is to provide a simple yet secure mechanism for storing digital assets in a decentralized vault.

## Project Vision
The vision of EtherVault is to evolve into a robust decentralized asset management platform that emphasizes security, transparency, and user control. EtherVault aims to offer a seamless and safe experience for managing digital funds in Web3 ecosystems.

## Key Features
- **Secure Deposits**: Users can deposit Ether directly into the vault.
- **Safe Withdrawals**: Users can withdraw Ether from their stored balance at any time.
- **Transparent Ledger**: All deposits and withdrawals are stored on the blockchain.
- **Event Logging**: Every transaction emits an event for easy tracking.

## Future Scope
- **Multi-signature Withdrawals** for advanced security.
- **Time-Locked Vaults** for long-term savings and staking.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for enterprise-level fund management.
- **Support for ERC20 Tokens** to expand beyond Ether.
- **Integration with Layer-2 Networks** for cheaper and faster transactions.
- **Web Dashboard** for user-friendly interaction with the vault.
